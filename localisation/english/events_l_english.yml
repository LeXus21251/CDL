 news.0.t:0 "Worrying situation in Japan"
 news.0.d:0 "Traders on the Dejima were expelled from the Japanese islands without explanation. The situation has been tense recently. Was it the coup? Civil War? or maybe other event?"
 news.1.t:0 "Independence of the Assyrian Republic"
 news.1.d:0 "The situation in the eastern fringes of the Ottoman Empire had long been unstable due to tensions between the government and local peoples. A few days ago, local garrisons were disarmed and Ottoman officials imprisoned in the streets of Hakkari, Tur Abdin and Al-Hasakah. There was also a short shooting between the rebels and the military in the city of Hakkari. The streets of the rebellious regions no longer see Ottoman parades with brass bands playing in honor of the Caliph - life has returned to its natural state, holy icons return to the images of houses, and the Assyrians celebrate their liberation. The rebellious regions announced the creation of the Assyrian Republic, and Naum Faiq, an activist known in those areas, became its head. What does this mean for the Ottomans?"
 news.2.t:0 "Armenians declare independence!"
 news.2.d:0 "Barely more than a week has passed since the declaration of independence of the Assyrian Republic, and another news has spread around the world ... Military maps of the Ottoman Empire have received a new enemy in the eastern lands. The whole event was a bit more brutal than the overthrow of the Ottoman rule in Assyria. Ottoman troops expected a possible rebellion in Armenia, and there were many shootings between Armenians and Ottomans during the liquidation of the Ottoman garrisons and administration. However, the effect was achieved - the Republic of Armenia was established in the city of Van, encompassing all the rebellious areas. Is the sick man of Europe losing his eastern organs?"
 news.3.t:0 "Another revolt in the Ottoman Empire"
 news.3.d:0 "In the Ottoman Empire, a huge bomb of the declaration of independence probably exploded by the national minorities oppressed in those regions. Within two weeks, Assyria and Armenia declared independence - now the Pontic Republic has joined them. There is a great Greek community in Pontus, which has decided to follow in the footsteps of the Armenians and the Assyrians. In the city of Amasya, there was a fairly peaceful overthrow of the Ottoman power - taking the city into control of the newly established Pontic Republic without shootings. Could three new countries soon appear on the maps of the world?"
 news.4.t:0 "Caliphate of Lower Mesopotamia"
 news.4.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire begins to lose its control not only in the Christian regions. Over the last two days, the Ottoman army's subjects in the Vilajet region of Basra have been completely disarmed. The reaction of the Ottoman troops from the rest of the empire was not possible as communication was completely destroyed between the Ottoman administration of Basra and Constantinopole. It could only mean one thing - revolution! A new state appeared on military maps - the Shiite Caliphate of Lower Mesopotamia. Now wait for this - which Caliph will win in that region?"
 news.5.t:0 "Mahmoud Barzanja's Rebellion!"
 news.5.d:0 "In the Ottoman Empire, the boil is on. The Ottomans lost control of almost all of Mesopotamia, western Armenia, and Pont. Now there was another rebellion, somewhat unexpected by the empire. The Kurds have served the Ottomans for many years - although there have been several attempts to rebel in history, most people saw Kurds in the new internal conflicts of the Ottoman Empire in the place of those suppressing rebellions. And yet! The influential Sheikh Muhamad Barznji announced the rise of an independent Kurdistan and together with the Kurdish tribes that he befriended and wanted independence. He was even proclaimed the king of one for his actions. Was the fall of the Ottoman Empire east of Anatolia a question of 'when?' and not 'whether?' ?"
 news.6.t:0 "Independence of the Republic of Baghdad"
 news.6.d:0 "The entire power of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East is crumbling. The Mesopotamian Shi'ites have already announced their new state - now the Sunnis have. Arab national identity is reviving, as are many other nations occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Recently, another declaration of independence was born - this time it was the Republic of Baghdad. This Arab democracy occupied some Sunni territories in the remnants of Ottoman Mesopotamia through several organized coups of the Ottoman administration and disarmament of garrisons. How will a newcomer to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire cope?"
 news.7.t:0 "Establishment of the Emirate of Asir"
 news.7.d:0 "The fall of the rule of the Ottoman Empire also began at the easternmost ends of their rule in the Arabian Peninsula. Although the Asir area is not something particularly significant and great, the rebellion of the local tribes against the Ottoman Empire and the announcement of their own state show us that the internal state of the sick man of Europe is very weak. What impact will the possible collapse of the Ottoman power in the Middle East have on the future of this region of the world?"
 news.8.t:0 "Independent Yemen"
 news.8.d:0 "Another independent state was established near Asir - the Kingdom of Yemen. Due to the cut off of Ottoman power from Yemen by a rebellion in Asir located north of it, the Arabs there decided to take the matter into their own hands. From today they are no longer subjects of the Ottoman Empire - they are lords of their kingdom. Possible changes to the world maps will be really big..."
 news.9.t:0 "Revolt in Hejaz"
 news.9.d:0 "Almost all areas of the Ottoman Empire in the coast of the Red Sea were occupied by rebels. The first was Asir, the second was Yemen - and now the newly founded Kingdom of Hejaz is coming to all revolt. Arab rebels managed to capture most of northern Hejaz along with Medina, but the Ottoman garrison continued in the holy city of Mecca and in the surrounding areas. When will the Ottoman Empire agree to the demands of internal rebels?"
 news.10.t:0 "Independent Syria"
 news.10.d:0"Revolutions in the Ottoman Empire have already reached the territories of the Levant. Despite the fact that this region is highly diverse in terms of culture, the Arab population there united in order to declare their Republic of Syria. The fledgling Arab democracy in the Middle East thus joined the long roster of nationalists fighting for their homelands against the Ottoman Empire. The fall of the Ottoman power in the Middle East is apparently only a matter of time."
 news.11.t:0 "Alawite Revolt in the Ottoman Levant"
 news.11.d:0 "Anti-Ottoman revolts arose not only in the southern Levant. On the coast of the northern Levant, near Latakia, there was a revolt of the local Alawite population against the troops and the Ottoman administration! This revolt, although small and poorly organized, shows the poor condition of the Ottoman Empire. We will probably soon see the great trains of Ottoman troops withdrawing from the Middle East back to Anatolia..."
 news.12.t:0 "The Druze create their own sultanate"
 news.12.d:0 "All the turmoil in the Middle East controlled by the Ottoman Empire also spread to the nearby puppet - Sheikhdom of Anazzah. The Druze living in the northern part of that area disobeyed the sheikh and proclaimed their own sultanate. How will the sheikh allied to the caliph of Istanbul deal with the Druze?"

Let's show this ridiculous democracy from Baghdad what it means to return our rule in Mesopotamia!"
 ottoman.6.t:0 "A small emirate south of Hejaz"
