  TON_french_protection_desc:0 "The tribes on the islands of Tonga were divided until European colonization. Throughout the 19th century there were a series of agreements until the islands finally united in 1845.\n\nThe §tKingdom of Tonga§! successfully resisted colonization so the §BFrench§! government came to the conclusion to create a protectorate. It was proclaimed in 1897 and §OSiaosi Tupou II§! remained king."
