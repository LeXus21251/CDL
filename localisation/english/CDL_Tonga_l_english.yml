He was crowned King of Tonga at the age of 18, in the capital, §GNuku'alofa§!.\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Siaosi kept a strong policy towards §BFrance§! and repelled one and the last French invasion of the islands.

Throughout the 19th century there were a series of agreements until the islands finally united in 1845.\n\nThe §tKingdom of Tonga§! successfully resisted colonization so the §BFrench§! government came to the conclusion to create a protectorate. It was proclaimed in 1897 and §OSiaosi Tupou II§! remained king."
