   AST_CDL_DESC:0 "The French expedition led by Nicolas Baudin to Nouvelle Hollande established the first settlement there - Aureum, in 1783. The French announced their claims to the entire east coast and established many settlements along it over the next twenty years. In 1820 there was a Breton conference establishing the borders with the British colony, but unlike them, the French recognize the island as part of the Pacifica continent. From the very beginning of the colony's existence, it waged a constant war with natives who are not considered human. In 1902, the King of France proclaimed the colony a kingdom, placing his wife on the throne."

The first settlement and at the same time the capital was Perth. Three years later, the border with Nouvelle Hollande was established under an agreement with the Breton Conference. The colony grew, helped by a large influx of Celts from the United Republic. The year 1850 brought a treaty with the aborigines, ensuring mutual security. At the same time, the Union of Oz was proclaimed, in which presidential elections are held every 5 years. The ambition of the Ossies is to unite the continent under their rule."
