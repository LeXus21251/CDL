  SUPEREVENT_ITSUSHI_WAR_QUOTE:0 "'The strong manly ones in life are those who understand the meaning of the word patience. Patience means restraining one's inclinations. There are seven emotions - joy, anger, anxiety, adoration, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient. I am not as strong as I might be, but I have long known and practiced patience. And if my descendants wish to be as I am, they must study patience.'\n§Y-Tokugawa Ieayasu-§!"
