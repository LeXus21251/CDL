Thanks to winning the Four Years' War, the country could afford such an expense. The first head of the League and at the same time the commander of the expedition to Madagascar was §OMaurycy Beniowski§!.\n\nThanks to Beniowski's successes on the island, the League began to send more and more resources and people, and a campaign was conducted to encourage people to settle in Madagascar. Thanks to such actions, the economy, infrastructure and comfort of living on the island were improving.\n\nIn 1869, already as the §8Crown Protectorate of Malagasy§!, practically an independent state, but still in the eyes of the law as dependent on Poland, an agreement was concluded in which Malagasy became the leader of the Polish Maritime and Colonial League."

It was built on the site of a medium-sized settlement and is called §GPort Firaisankina§!, which means Port of Unity.\n\nThe city was built in less than five years and the port uses the most modern methods to help local trade, which has given the place the title of §6"Pearl of Malagasy"§!."

  MAD_past_scar_desc:0 "The older inhabitants of the island still remember the dark and cruel events of the past.\n\n§OJan Beniowski§! who for 30 years sowed terror as the cruellest king of Polish origin. He chose the path of aggressive expansion throughout the island, usually taking no prisoners and resolving matters by force instead of diplomacy.\n\nDuring his reign morale dropped significantly in every social group, or even in the army. In 1876 a §Rcoup d'état§! took place in which he was killed, and he failed to control the last independent state on the island, §3Antankarana§!.\n\nAfter Jan death, he was succeeded by his son §OHenryk§!.

In the same year, the construction of the city of §GRajów§!, which means Paradise, began.\n\nNow, after so many years, King §OAntoni Beniowski§!, wanting to eliminate inequalities, established a new administrative division and formed a new government that has representatives from each native ethnic group."
