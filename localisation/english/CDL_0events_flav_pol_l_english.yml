  polflav.0.d:0 "Polish politician and writer Stanisław Wokulski has published a new novel, called "Trzy pokolenia", or  "Three Generations"  in English. It weighs upon the issues of the Commonwealth's society\n\nThe story takes place in Lwów and tells a story of Bolesław Prus - A rich entrepreneur of Noble descent and Izabela Łęcka, a poor burgherwoman who works as a nurse during the Second War of Polish Succession. They meet in a theatre, where she immediately falls in love with him. Bolesław is very popular with women, but he rejects every attempt at hookup, as he believes that relationships and love in general hinder economic and spiritual development. He likes to say about himself that he is a lone wolf, or a sigma.\n\nThe novel ends with Prus leaving the Commonwealth and Europe in search of a better future, while Łęcka was forced to join the monastery. The interesting thing about Wokulski's novel is that the the ending is ambiguous and should be subject to the reader's own analysis and interpretation. Despite many controversies, and the author being accused of misogyny, the book is a bestseller in the Polish Crown and is becoming increasingly more popular in Europe due to numerous translations."
