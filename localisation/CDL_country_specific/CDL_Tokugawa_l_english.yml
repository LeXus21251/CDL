As a result of previous events, the Shogun decided to close the islands in 1635 under the Sakoku Edict which introduced a number of restrictions and allowing only very limited trade with the Dutch.\nIn 1868, Tokugawa Yoshinobu being a proponent of modernizing the country eased the Sakoku Edict by opening up to trade,diplomacy etc. However, as a result of the opening, the Russian Empire forcibly occupied the Chishima Islands in 1874 leading to Japan's re-enclosure. Living in fear of further colonization and society began to modernize. In recent years there has been growing unrest over a newly developing religion and supporters of the Emperor"
